# First Contributions

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what's better than actually doing the stuff in a practice environment? This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

If you don't have git on your machine, [install it]( https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repo by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="assets/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repo to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repo, click on the clone button and then click the *copy to clipboard* icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```
where "url you just copied" (without the quote marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/first-contributions.git
```
where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository in GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd first-contributions
```
Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:
```
git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:
```
git checkout -b add-alonzo-church
```
(The name of the branch does not need to have the word *add* in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)



## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:
```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a  `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/create-pull-request.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

## Where to go from here?

Congrats!  You just completed the standard _fork -> clone -> edit -> PR_ workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor!
